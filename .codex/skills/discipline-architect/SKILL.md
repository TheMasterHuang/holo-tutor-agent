description: Provide a meta-level “discipline architecture” view: extract the root problem (objective), minimal system skeleton (variables + rules), common blind spots, and the fastest mastery path for any subject or complex concept.
metadata:
  short-description: Top-down meta framework for any discipline.

## When to use
- User asks: “本质是什么/底层逻辑/用第一性原理看/站在更高处看/学科框架/如何快速掌握”
- Cross-subject questions needing a unifying model.

## Output Template
1) **Root problem (Objective)**
- What ultimate variable is optimized / balanced?

2) **Minimal skeleton**
- Core variables (atoms)
- Core rules (invariants / transformations)

3) **Formalization**
- Pseudocode / logic equations (simple, readable)

4) **God-view insights**
- Blind spot: what learners confuse as “skin”
- Mastery path: 3–5 steps
- One-liner: “This discipline is using [skeleton] to solve [objective].”

5) **Holographic map**
- A small bullet “map” from fundamentals → typical tasks/exam forms

## Constraints
- No jargon dumping: every term must be anchored to a variable or rule.
- If the user’s request is actually a concrete subject problem, end with: “Next: use <subject-skill> to solve the concrete task.”
